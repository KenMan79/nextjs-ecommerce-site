# Next JS e-commerce Workshop

Jamstack frameworks are changing the way we build top-of-the-line experiences on the web. They are performant, secure and enable developers to build web apps faster than before. In this workshop, Nick DeJesus will walk you through what it's like to build an e-commerce site using NextJS, use-shopping-cart and theme-ui. You will learn how serverless functions help you make secure transactions and how to build accessible UI components that extend use-shopping-cart's abilities.
